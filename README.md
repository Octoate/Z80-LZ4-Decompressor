# Z80-LZ4-Decompressor

This repository is currently a playground to develop a LZ4 decompressor written in Z80 assembly language.
The idea behind the C# code in the repository is to first understand the LZ4 compression and write a compatible decompressor for stream based LZ4 compression. The next step is to convert the LZ4 compressor to Z80 assembly language and test it with unit tests and a C# Z80 emulator.
